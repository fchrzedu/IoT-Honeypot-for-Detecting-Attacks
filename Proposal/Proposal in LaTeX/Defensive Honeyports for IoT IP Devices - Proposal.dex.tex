Abstract of the project goes here

The Internet of Things (IoT) is vastly expanding, driving a brand new and complex wave of device inter-connectivity worldwide, with an approximate 27-billion devices by the end of 2025\textit{\citep{autobits2025iot}}.

\section{Aims \&{} Objectives}\label{sec:aimAndObjectives}

\subsection{Aim}\label{sec:aim}

To evaluate the effectiveness of containment and sand-boxing mechanisms, in preventing malware propagation regarding its spread, within an IP IoT Honeypot framework and environment compared to a low-interaction vanilla Honeypot.

\subsection{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}
The objectives are as follows:
\begin{itemize}

	\item To design and deploy a controlled Honeypot framework for IoT IP devices, seated within Virtual Machines,
	\item To deploy a minimum of two separate Honeypots:
		\begin{description}
		\item[1.] Low-interaction Vanilla Honeypot, mimicking usual IoT devices, 
		\item[2.] High-interaction Honeypot within a secure container,
		\end{description}
	\item To create a virtual network, where each IoT device and VM have logical addressing and are protected through subnets, mimicing a small office network,
	\item To collect and store the following malware properties for quantitative comparison and analysis:
		\begin{description}
		\item[1.] Network traffic,
		\item[2.] Payloads,
		\item[3.] Malware type
		\item[4.] Activity data
		\item[5.] Propagation attempts outside the container.
		\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}\label{sec:scope}

% The project involves the development and deployment of a \textbf{contained IoT Honeypot environment} for IoT IP devices, comparing two separate deployments. It is designed to help understand the theoretical importance of creating honeypots within a secure container, and evaluating its success against low-interaction vanilla honeypots \citep{Kocaogullar2023honeypots}; further supporting research of malware propagation.


The project involves the design, development and deployment of a contained IoT Honeynet environment for a range of various IoT IP devices and varying Honeypots, within a small office network. Each executed piece of malware will have its data collected from both Honeypots, which will then be stored and processed within a separate Virtual Machine outside the environments subnet. 

It is designed to evaluate the succesfulness of a high-interaction contained Honeypot against a low-interaction implementation, with the aim to further support pre-existing research regarding malware propagation and identify attacker behaviour patterns  \textit{\citep{Kocaogullar2023honeypots}}.

%The honeypots will be implemented using Cowrie, a medium-interaction SSH/Telnet based honeypot framework \citep{cowrie-documentation}, that has capabilities for both medium and high-interaction modes \textit{(shell and proxy)}. The sandboxed honeypot will be deployed using a combination of Cowrie, FireJail, Doker and, Linux-based kernel security \textit{(AppArmour/seccomp)}. The framework will exist within a Linux-based Virtual Machine, where a separate VM is used for malware data analysis.
